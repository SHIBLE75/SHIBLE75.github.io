   <p> His Name Is SHAKIB AL HASAN !</P>
   <P> HE IS THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER IN OUR COUNTRY..
   Shakib Al Hasan is without a doubt the biggest name to have emerged from Bangladesh cricket circles.
   Being a genuine all-rounder, Shakib is a vital cog in Bangladesh's line-up. 
   He has been a consistent performer for his country, over the years.
   Shakib first came into notice when he played cricket for several villages near his hometown of Magura.
   He spent time honing his skills at a government run sports facility and was picked for the Under-19 squad for the tri-series featuring England and Sri Lanka.
   He scored a 86-ball century and picked up three wickets in the final to help the team defeat Sri Lanka. 
   This earned him selection for the series against Zimbabwe.</P>
